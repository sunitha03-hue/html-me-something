    <h2>2. Tamarind Rice</h2>
<h4> Ingredients </h4> <p> Mustard seeds - 1 Tsp, Urad Dhal - 1 Tsp, Channa Dhal - 1 Tsp, Curry Leaves - 1 String,

Channal dhal - 2Tsp, Pepper - 3/4Tsp, Fenugreek Seeds - less than 1/4 Tsp.</p>

<h4> Steps </h4> <p> Add 2 small pieces of hing to hot oil. When it puffs up, transfer it to a plate seperately. To the same oil, add 5-6 red chillies. Toss it on a mdeium flame. Toss it till your chilli puffs up. Do nor burn it. Now add coriander seeds to the same pan. Don't add any oil. Toss it till there is a colour change. Add channa dha;. Roast it till golden brown. Add less then 1/4Tsp of fenugreek seeds. Add 1Tsp of pepper. Once cooled make a fine powder. Add gingely oil to a pan.
