<h3><div>2. Tamarind Rice</div></h3>
<h4> Ingredients </h4> 
<p> Mustard seeds - 1 Tsp, Urad Dhal - 1 Tsp, Channa Dhal - 1 Tsp, Curry Leaves - 1 String, 
Red chilli - 1, Peanuts - 2-3 Tbsp, Tamarind - 1 Amla size soaked in 1 cup of water, Turmeric - 1/4Tsp,

Channal dhal - 2Tsp, Pepper - 3/4Tsp, Fenugreek Seeds - less than 1/4 Tsp.
</p>

<h4> Steps </h4> <p> Add 2 small pieces of hing to hot oil. 
When it puffs up, transfer it to a plate seperately. To the same oil, add 5-6 red chillies. Toss it on a mdeium flame. Toss it till your chilli puffs up. Do nor burn it. Now add coriander seeds to the same pan. Don't add any oil. Toss it till there is a colour change. Add channa dha;. Roast it till golden brown. Add less then 1/4Tsp of fenugreek seeds. Add 1Tsp of pepper. Once cooled make a fine powder. Add gingely oil to a pan. When the oil is hot add Mustard seeds, urad dhal, Channa dhal, Rosated peanuts and curry leaves. I missed the seasoning part alone. I am really sorry. Now add tamarind water to this. Add turmeric powder. Now add the powder. Mix everything well. Add required salt. When it starts to boil, cover the pan with lid and cook on low flame. The channa dhal in masal powder will thicken the gravy. Add required salt and Tsp of oil and rice before adding tamarind paste.

<a name = "3.Curd Rice"></a>
<h3><div>3. Curd Rice</h3>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p> 1 cup of rice, 2-2½ cups of water, ½ cup of milk, Plain or unflavored yogurt, 1 tablespoon of oil, 
½ teaspoon of mustard seeds, ¼ teaspoon of grated ginger, Few sprigs of curry leaves, 1 green chili (split lengthwise), 
Pinch of salt, Grated carrot/pomegranate seeds (optional).

<h4> Steps </h4>
<p> Prepare the rice with excess water to obtain slightly overcooked rice, meaning that the rice is 
soft and slightly clumped together. When the rice is still hot, mash lightly with a spoon. Now comes 
the tempering process that takes your normal curd rice to the next level! Heat the oil in a pan and 
add the mustard seeds when the oil is sufficiently hot. Once the mustard seeds begin spluttering, 
add the chili, grated ginger and curry leaves. Slowly add the milk to your rice curd mixture until 
the desired consistency is reached. Add the tempered mustard seeds and chili, mixing well. Sprinkle 
some salt to taste, and you’re finished! You may also add some pomegranate seeds or grated carrots 
if you wish!</p>
